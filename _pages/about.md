I have spent 10 years working as a physical therapist in an ICU, leading rehabilitation and respiratory care for patients who are undergoing ventilation and life-saving devices. 

In pursuit of my goal to acquire the necessary skills to describe the epidemiology and formulate research, I earned a Master of Public Health in Epidemiology at Emory University. My research is focused on discovering biomarkers associated with the resilience or progression to critical illness and its complication, I am continuing research in a Ph.D. program in Computer Science and Informatics at Emory University. 

I actively engages in a national educational organization in critical care in Japan to expand the latest research to enhance patient care.
