I, **Seibi Kobara**, am a critical care physical therapist specializing in respiratory therapy and a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Informatics at Emory University. Over the past decade, I have led rehabilitation and respiratory care for critically ill patients in ICUs, emergency departments, and neonatal ICUs, focusing on those undergoing ventilation and life-saving interventions.

Driven by a commitment to advance patient care through research, I earned a Master of Public Health in Epidemiology at Emory University, supported by a prestigious [Fulbright scholarship](https://www.fulbright.jp/eng/index.html){:target="_blank"}. My research centers on identifying biomarkers linked to resilience or progression in critical illness, and I am furthering this work in my Ph.D. program. I am honored to be a recipient of the inaugural [Quad Fellowship](https://www.quadfellowship.org/){:target="_blank"}, which connects me with top STEM researchers and enhances my training.

In addition to my research, I am actively involved in the [Japanese Society of Education for Physicians and Trainees in Intensive Care](https://www.jseptic.com/en/){:target="_blank"}, where I work to disseminate cutting-edge research and improve critical care practices in Japan.
